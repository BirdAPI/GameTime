*This software is Pre-Alpha.  The game scraping and management is somewhat working, however there is no progress on the downloading portion* 

GameTime is a CherryPy based web server/application written in python.  The goal of this project is to be a video game manager and automatic downloader.  GameTime gets its roots and inspiration from SickBeard and CouchPotato.
